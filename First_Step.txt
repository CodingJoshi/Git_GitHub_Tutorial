1) Your Identity

The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address.
This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
	git config --global user.name "John Doe"
	git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system.
If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re 
in that project.

2) You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using:
	git config --list --show-origin

3) Your default branch name
By default Git will create a branch called master when you create a new repository with git init.
From Git version 2.28 onwards, you can set a different name for the initial branch.
To set main as the default branch name do:
	git config --global init.defaultBranch main

4) initialise a empty git repository 
	git init
5) Cloning an Existing Repository
	git clone <url>
