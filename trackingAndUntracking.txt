we have 4 different type of files 
1) Untracked  // initial file which is not tracked by git
2) Staged	// git starts tracking the file it is stagged now
3) Unmodified/Commited	// finally saved by git commited to repository
4) Modified	// some changes/modifications done in Unmodified/committed file


Stagging a Untracked file
	git add <fileName>
Commiting a stagged file
	git commit -m "message"
commiting a Modified file
	git commit -a -m "message"
Untracking a stagged file
	git restore --staged
